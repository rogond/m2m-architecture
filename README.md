# AWS Event-Driven Architecture with Terraform

This project sets up an event-driven architecture in AWS using Terraform with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: exposes a `/notifications` endpoint.
- **SNS Topic**: receives messages from the API Gateway.
- **SQS Queues**: 3 queues subscribed to the SNS topic.
- **Lambda Functions**: triggered by SQS messages, implemented in .NET 8.
- **IAM Roles**: secure permissions for Lambda to access SQS, SNS, and CloudWatch.
